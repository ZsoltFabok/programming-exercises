Given the following input structure as a String: [1, 3, [4, 5, [7, 1]], 1, [10, 1]]

Implement an application that can process this structure, and returns the maximum value.

* Constraint 1: in your code values between '[' and ']' should be a list and you should use recursion to find the maximum value
