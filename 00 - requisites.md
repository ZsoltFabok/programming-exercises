These are the common requirements for the exerices:

* you have one repository on github (make sure that I'm a contributor) for each exercise
* when you have something new, create a pull request
* it is buidable and testable with gradle
* it works as it is described in the exercise
* it is integrated with travis-ci - when there is a pull request, travis should run
* it follows the clean code and KISS principles
* it is connected to a quality checker such as sonar
* has the proper test suite based on the test pyramid (unit, integration, user acceptance tests)
