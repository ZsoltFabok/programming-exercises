Given an organisation that has one CEO, 1-2 Secretaries, 1-10 managers, 1-4 Java, and 1-5 CPP developers. Each empolyee has a name, and a salary. A CEO can have managers, secretaries, and developers, managers can have secretaries (can be the same as the CEO's) and developers, developers have nobody. A CEO can tell the vision, the managers can tell the directions, secretaries can order stuff, and developers can do development: either java and CPP.

Implement an application that randomly generates an organisation and can tell how much the manpower costs, prints who is doing what, and the manager chain of each developer.
